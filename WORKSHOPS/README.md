# Workshops

The workshops delivered practical exercises to accompany the lecture materials and they led me through understanding the concepts on a deep level. Workshops 1-4 cover variables, lists, loops (iteration), conditionals and functions.

I didn't complete all of the exercises, and I'm sure there are mistakes mixed in there as well as better ways of doing things, which I might go back and do in an IPython Notebook some time.

### Going back now:
- I notice that I do dangerous things with my variable names, such as reassigning the function name within the scope of the function, which appears not to have troubled my code too much, but I'm sure is bad practice.
- You can see that my code becomes slightly more sophisticated as I start using docstrings, ```if __name__ == "__main__"``` etc.
- I especially struggled with workshop 7 and didn't get it, maybe because I didn't have the time. It is only now, when I look back three years later that I can see a clear way to do it. Nice example of how I have actually learnt something in that time.
