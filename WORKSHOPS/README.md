# Workshops

The workshops delivered practical exercises to accompany the lecture materials and they led me through understanding the concepts on a deep level. Workshops 1-4 cover variables, lists, loops (iteration), conditionals and functions.

I didn't complete all of the exercises, and I'm sure there are mistakes mixed in there as well as better ways of doing things, which I might go back and do in an IPython Notebook some time.
