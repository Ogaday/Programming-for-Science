# Programming for Science Continuous Assessment 1

This is my first assessed bit of programming. The worksheet consisted of five questions. The first was to spot errors in some sample code. The latter four where some simple programming challenges involving implementing formulae and string manipulation. I didn't know about ```if __name__ == "__main__":``` so my functions can't be imported easily.

In question 2, the lecturer specifically wanted an answer that used a loop to find the sum term by term, rather than by using the formula for the sum of the first n squares:  Sn = n(n+1)/2

All code is written for python 2.7 and can be run in the shell as follows:

```
$ python foo.py
```
