# Programming for Science Continuous Assessment 1

This is my first assessed bit of programming. The worksheet consisted of five questions. The first was to spot errors in some sample code. The latter four where some simple programming challenges involving implementing formulae and string manipulation. I didn't know about if '__name__ == "__main__":' so my functions can't be imported easily.
